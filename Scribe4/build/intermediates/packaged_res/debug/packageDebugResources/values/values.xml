    <string name="rules_basicmoves">The two players take turns marking squares, one 
square per turn, until the entire super grid is filled. Players are not allowed 
to pass on their turn. On your first turn, you can claim any square on the super 
grid. The mini grid of your last move is treated as a map. The square you last 
claimed (marked with a small white dot) points to the mini grid in which you must 
make your next move. For example, in this screenshot, Red\'s last move was in the 
upper-right corner of a mini grid, so Red must now play in the upper-right mini 
grid. If your last move points to a completely filled mini grid, you can make 
your next move anywhere in the super grid.</string>

    <string name="rules_glyph_example_1_text">Blue has four Singles and Red has two 
Singles. With a score of 4-2, Blue is the winner.</string>

    <string name="rules_glyph_example_2_text">Blue has a Pipe (4 points) and Red has
a Double and a Triple (5 points). Red is the winner.</string>

    <string name="rules_glyph_example_3_text">Blue has the House glyph, which is worth
7 points. Red has two Singles for 2 points. Blue wins.</string>
    <string name="rules_glyph_example_4_grid">OOO ++O +++</string>
    <string name="rules_glyph_example_4_text">Red has the Pipe glyph, for 4 points. 
Blue doesn\'t have any glyph at all, so Red wins the mini grid.</string>
    <string name="rules_glyphs">Press \"menu\" to see the 19 glyphs of Scribe. Each 
glyph is worth the number of dots that compose it. For example the J is worth 
six points. A glyph also represents its own mirror image and rotations. Glyphs 
appearing as a subset of a larger group don\'t count. When a mini grid is 
completely filled, the glyph points are tallied and the high score wins.</string>
    <string name="rules_intro"> Scribe is a pen and paper game for two players. Nine mini grids together form 
 one super grid. Draws cannot occur in Scribe. Mark Steere invented
 Scribe on October 1, 2006.</string>
